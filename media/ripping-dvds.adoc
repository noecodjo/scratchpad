= Riping DVDs

In order to backup DVDs I own, I had to install all the usual stuff but
something I missed this time and that took me a while to figure out is:

* install regionset
* set region to 1 on current drive (had never been set)
* *then* remove ~/.dvdcss/ otherwise output is garbled and it is strange
* then the thing started working in vlc and handbrake
