== Common Protocols

* Modbus (but not that much really)
* Siemens S<something>
* EtherNet/IP (not the Ethernet IT folks think about)

=== Modbus

Most software poking the embedded systems is Windows-based.

== Architecture

HMIs poke PLCs which control and monitor the devices over serial lines or
ethernet.
