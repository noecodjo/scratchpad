= ELF

== Section headers vs Program headers

`objdump -D` prints nothing. `objdump -b binary -m i386 -D`

Unfortunately objdump relies on ELF _section_ headers, which are
meaningless/optional in executables, and ignores program headers.

This naturally leads to a powerful way to hide malicious code from objdump,
e.g. making a rootkit disassemble as "hello world".

The section headers can even point fake symbol/strings tables separate from
those used for dynamic linking, to hide system() etc.
