= Unpacking

== the Ollydbg way

* breakpoint on anything memory related (Alt-G then F2)

    VirtualAlloc, HeapCreate, LocalAlloc, VirtualProtect, ...

* Run (F9)
* Scroll until the end of the allocation function. Add a breakpoint there (F2).
* Continue (F8)
* When end of function is reached, right-click on EAX then "Follow in Dump"
* Add hardware breakpoint (write)
* Continue (F8)
* If it breaks on another allocation, add another hw mem breakpoint
* If it breaks on memory breakpoint check for executable header
* Repeat last steps as necessary
* Once you have an MZ / PE header then on section right-click "Backup -> Save
  data"
* Run foremost or binwalk on the dump to extract the EXE
