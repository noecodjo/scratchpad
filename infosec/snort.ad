== snort rules testing w/ stdout output

Disable output statement and put in this one in:

    output alert_full: stdout

Read pcap:

    sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -K none -k none -r ../infected_hosts/91.121.176.44/t2.cap

The `-k none -K none` is to avoid checksum errors since you get these in most
environments where checksums are done at the hardware level.

Optional: Pass global variables

    -S HOME_NET=91.121.176.0/24
