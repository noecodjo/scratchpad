=== Diff asciidoc source

Generate a colorized patch of changes in HTML:

    wdiff file-1.1 file-1.2 | colordiff | ~/src/ansifilter/src/ansifilter -H > 1.1-to-1.2.html

or

    git diff --color-words draft-1.1 | ~/src/ansifilter/src/ansifilter -H > 1.1-to-1.2.html

or vimdiff with :TOhtml (set background=light and colorscheme default first)
