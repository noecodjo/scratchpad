Stuff I quickly write to validate or recall certain language, library or 
design behavior.

Why?
----

Someone once told me that it is often quicker to write a simple program to 
validate some behavior than to debug or print a bigger program to exhibit 
the behavior. I really liked the advice, especially applied to a princess 
(high-maintenance) language like Perl or for stuff I don't do often (like
regexp in bash).

Since then I've been writting stupidly simple snippets and keeping them around
because from time to time I get back to them or expand them.
