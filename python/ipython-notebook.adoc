== Shell execution

You can use `!` to execute shell commands just like in classic ipython.

It also work to assign to lists

    files = !ls

== Variables in shell

    file = "somefile"
    !ls {somefile}

== Parallelize

Setup

    # ipython parallel setup
    # http://minrk.github.io/scipy-tutorial-2011/
    # started 'default' cluster with 10 engines
    from IPython import parallel as p
    rc = p.Client()

Do stuff

    # list engine ids
    #rc.ids

    # grab a direct view on all engines
    dview = rc[::]

    # import stuff
    # or the @require() decorator is also a possibility
    with dview.sync_imports():
        import os

    # straight apply function, blocking
    #dview.block = True
    #dview.apply(lambda: os.getpid())

    # fancier way with remote decorator
    #@dview.remote(block=True)
    #def getpid():
    #    return os.getpid()
    #
    #getpid()

    # a more meaningful example
    def list_files(country):
        files = !ls /srv/files/{country}/
        return files

    dview.block = True
    dview.map(list_files, ['canada', 'usa'])
